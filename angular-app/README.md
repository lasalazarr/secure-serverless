# Auth0 Angular Login

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to an Angular application using Auth0's Lock widget from the hosted login page. The sample uses the Angular CLI.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are using the server provided by the Angular CLI, that URL is `http://localhost:3000/callback`.

Clone the repo or download it from the Angular quickstart page in Auth0's documentation. Install the Angular CLI and the dependencies for the app.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
cd 01-Login
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID and Domain

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.ts.example` file to `auth0-variables.ts` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there. This file is located in `src/app/auth/`.

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with the Angular CLI can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** The default Angular CLI port is `4200`, but Auth0 samples use port `3000` instead.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-and-domain).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account
